ScalaProjectCreator
===================

Will create scala project to be used by SBT. Written in Ruby


To use this project clone the repository down. Enter folder from the command line and do 'chmod +x sbt.rb'

You can now do ./sbt.rb FILENAME and it will create the directory in the folder you are currently in. I would move the file to wherever you want to put the new directory at.
